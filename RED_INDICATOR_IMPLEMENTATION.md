# ✅ VISUAL INDICATOR FOR CANCELLED BOOKINGS

## What Was Changed:

### 1. **Backend: Keep Cancelled Bookings in Database** ✅
**File:** `support/views.py` - `api_cancel_booking()` function

**Changed From:** Deleting bookings (`booking.delete()`)
**Changed To:** Marking as cancelled (`booking.current_status = 'Cancelled'` and `booking.save()`)

**Result:** Cancelled bookings remain in the database but are marked with status 'Cancelled'

---

### 2. **Backend: Show ALL Bookings (Including Cancelled)** ✅
**File:** `support/views.py`

**Removed `.exclude(current_status='Cancelled')` filters** - Already removed in previous changes

**Result:** API and bot queries return ALL bookings, including cancelled ones

---

### 3. **Frontend: Red Visual Indicator** ✅
**File:** `templates/support/chat.html`

#### CSS Styling Added:
```css
.booking-cancelled { 
  border: 2px solid #dc3545 !important;  /* Red border */
  background: #fff5f5 !important;         /* Light red background */
  cursor: not-allowed !important;
}
.booking-cancelled:hover {
  background: #ffe5e5 !important;         /* Darker red on hover */
}
```

#### JavaScript Changes:
- Detects if `booking.current_status === 'Cancelled'`
- Adds `booking-cancelled` CSS class
- Shows **red "CANCELLED" badge** next to flight number
- Makes cancelled bookings **unclickable** (cursor: not-allowed)
- Shows message if user tries to click: "This booking has been cancelled and cannot be selected."
- Only active bookings can be selected
