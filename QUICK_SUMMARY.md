# üéØ CHANGES COMPLETED - SUMMARY

## What You Asked For:

1. ‚úÖ **"Once the booking is cancelled it should be immediately removed from the database"**
2. ‚úÖ **"If the user again enters booked flights query it should not display that particular booking"**
3. ‚úÖ **"If user enters other than the specified queries the bot must prompt as please enter a valid query"**

---

## What I Changed:

### 1. Modified `api_cancel_booking()` to DELETE bookings ‚úÖ

**Location:** `support/views.py` (around line 68-120)

**Change:** Instead of setting `booking.current_status = 'Cancelled'`, the booking is now **deleted** from the database:

```python
# OLD CODE (commented out):
# booking.current_status = 'Cancelled'
# booking.save()

# NEW CODE:
booking.delete()  # Booking is removed from database!
```

**Result:** Cancelled bookings are **completely removed** from the Booking table.

---

### 2. Removed All `.exclude(current_status='Cancelled')` Filters ‚úÖ

**Why?** Since cancelled bookings are deleted, we don't need to filter them anymore!

**Changed 7 locations in `support/views.py`:**

| Line | Function/Query | What Changed |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| 150 | `api_list_bookings_by_pnr()` | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 270 | Short intents check | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 276 | "Show my bookings" | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 288 | Cancel trip flow | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 308 | Flight status query | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 324 | Seat availability | Removed `.exclude()` |
| 344 | Pet travel query | Removed `.exclude()` |

**Before:**
```python
qs = Booking.objects.filter(pnr__iexact=verified_pnr).exclude(current_status='Cancelled')
```

**After:**
```python
qs = Booking.objects.filter(pnr__iexact=verified_pnr)
```

---

### 3. Updated Fallback Message for Invalid Queries ‚úÖ

**Location:** `support/views.py` (line 463)

**Message:**
```
Please enter a valid query. I can help you with:
‚Ä¢ Show my bookings
‚Ä¢ Flight status
‚Ä¢ Seat information
‚Ä¢ Pet travel policy
‚Ä¢ Cancel booking
```
