# üéâ ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTED SUCCESSFULLY!

## ‚úÖ Summary of Changes

### 1. **Added Multiple Bookings to Dataset**
- Created script: `tools/add_more_bookings.py`
- Added 9+ new bookings across multiple PNRs:
  - **ABC123**: 3 flights (JFK‚ÜíLAX, LAX‚ÜíSFO, SFO‚ÜíORD)
  - **XYZ123**: 4 flights (MIA‚ÜíBOS, BOS‚ÜíSEA, SEA‚ÜíDEN, + more)
  - **TEST123**: 6 flights (ATL‚ÜíDFW, DFW‚ÜíPHX, PHX‚ÜíLAS, + more)
  - **PQR456**: 2 flights (EWR‚ÜíMCO, MCO‚ÜíCLT)
- Total bookings in database: 21+

### 2. **Session-Based Booking Selection**
- Once user selects a booking, it's stored in `session['selected_booking_id']`
- All subsequent queries (`status`, `seat`, `pets`, `cancel`) use the selected booking automatically
- No need to re-select booking for each query
- Selection persists across multiple commands

### 3. **Cancelled Bookings Handling**
#### Backend Changes (`support/views.py`):
- Modified `api_list_bookings_by_pnr()` to exclude cancelled bookings:
  ```python
  qs = Booking.objects.filter(pnr__iexact=pnr).exclude(current_status='Cancelled')
  ```
- Updated ALL query endpoints (status, seat, pets, cancel) to filter out cancelled bookings
- When booking is cancelled:
  - `Booking.current_status` updated to `'Cancelled'`
  - Entry created in `CancelledBooking` table (separate database)
  - `session['selected_booking_id']` cleared automatically

#### Cancelled Bookings Database:
- Model: `CancelledBooking` (already existed)
- Fields:
  - `booking` (OneToOne with Booking)
  - `cancelled_at` (timestamp)
  - `cancellation_charges`
  - `refund_amount`
  - `refund_date`
- API Endpoint: `/api/cancelled_bookings?pnr=ABC123` - Lists all cancelled bookings for a PNR

### 4. **PNR Session Persistence**
- Added `/api/check_session` endpoint to check if PNR already verified
- Frontend calls this on page load
- If PNR verified, user doesn't need to re-enter it after page refresh
