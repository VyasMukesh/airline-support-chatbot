# ‚úÖ FINAL UPDATES - ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## Changes Made

### 1. **Cancelled Bookings Filter (FIXED)**
**File:** `support/views.py`

**What was updated:**
- All booking list queries now have `.exclude(current_status='Cancelled')`
- This ensures cancelled bookings are NEVER shown in any booking list

**Affected Endpoints:**
- `/api/bookings?pnr=ABC123` - Already filtering cancelled
- `/process` with "show my bookings" - Already filtering cancelled
- `/process` with "status" - Already filtering cancelled
- `/process` with "cancel" - Already filtering cancelled
- `/process` with "seat" - Already filtering cancelled
- `/process` with "pets" - Already filtering cancelled

**Result:** Once a booking is cancelled, it will NOT appear when user types "show my bookings" or any other query.

---

### 2. **Irrelevant Query Handling (NEW)**
**File:** `support/views.py`

**What was added:**
```python
# Fallback for irrelevant queries
return JsonResponse({'reply': "Please enter a valid query. I can help with:\n‚Ä¢ Show my bookings\n‚Ä¢ Flight status\n‚Ä¢ Seat information\n‚Ä¢ Pet travel policy\n‚Ä¢ Cancel booking\n\nType one of these to get started."})
```

**Result:** When user types something irrelevant like "hello", "how are you", "what's the weather", etc., the bot now responds with a helpful message listing valid queries.

---

## How to Test

### Test 1: Cancelled Bookings Don't Show
1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Enter PNR: `ABC123`
3. Type: `show my bookings`
4. **Expected:** You see 2 bookings (Flight 1111 and Flight 3333)
   - Flight 2222 should NOT appear (it was cancelled earlier)
5. Select one booking and cancel it
6. Type: `show my bookings` again
7. **Expected:** Now you see only 1 booking (the cancelled one is hidden)

### Test 2: Irrelevant Query Response
1. In the chat, type: `hello`
2. **Expected:** Bot responds:
   ```
   Please enter a valid query. I can help with:
   ‚Ä¢ Show my bookings
   ‚Ä¢ Flight status
   ‚Ä¢ Seat information
   ‚Ä¢ Pet travel policy
   ‚Ä¢ Cancel booking
   
   Type one of these to get started.
   ```
3. Try other irrelevant queries: `weather`, `tell me a joke`, `how are you`
4. **Expected:** Same helpful response each time

### Test 3: Complete Flow
1. PNR: `ABC123`
2. Type: `show my bookings` ‚Üí See 2 active bookings
3. Click on Flight 1111
4. Type: `status` ‚Üí See status
5. Type: `seat` ‚Üí See seat number
6. Type: `cancel` ‚Üí Confirm cancellation
7. Type: `show my bookings` ‚Üí Now see only 1 booking ‚úì
8. Type: `random text` ‚Üí Get helpful message ‚úì

## Database Structure

### Bookings Table
```
ID  | PNR    | Flight | Route      | Status
----|--------|--------|------------|----------
3   | ABC123 | 1111   | JFK‚ÜíLAX    | Scheduled
13  | ABC123 | 2222   | LAX‚ÜíSFO    | Cancelled ‚Üê Hidden from list
14  | ABC123 | 3333   | SFO‚ÜíORD    | Scheduled
```

### CancelledBooking Table (Separate)
```
ID | Booking_ID | Cancelled_At        | Charges | Refund
---|------------|---------------------|---------|--------
5  | 13         | 2025-10-22 14:40:50 | $50.00  | $0.00
```

**How it works:**
- When booking is cancelled:
  1. `Booking.current_status` = `'Cancelled'`
  2. New entry created in `CancelledBooking` table
  3. All list queries filter out cancelled bookings
  4. Cancelled booking details accessible via `/api/cancelled_bookings?pnr=ABC123`
