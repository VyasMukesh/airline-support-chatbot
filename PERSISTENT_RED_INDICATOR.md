# ✅ PERSISTENT RED INDICATOR FOR CANCELLED BOOKINGS

## What You Wanted:
"Even after cancelling a flight, if the user enters 'booked flights' query again, the previously cancelled flight must be displayed in red color."

## How It Works Now:

### ✅ Cancelled Bookings ALWAYS Show in Red

**Flow:**
```
1. User: "show my bookings"
   Bot shows: Flight 1111 (white), Flight 2222 (white), Flight 3333 (white)

2. User selects Flight 2222
   User: "cancel"
   User: [Yes, Cancel]
   Bot: "Your booking has been cancelled successfully"
   Bot shows: Flight 1111 (white), 🔴 Flight 2222 [CANCELLED] (RED), Flight 3333 (white)

3. User: "show my bookings" (AGAIN)
   Bot shows: Flight 1111 (white), 🔴 Flight 2222 [CANCELLED] (RED), Flight 3333 (white)

4. User: "show my bookings" (AGAIN AND AGAIN)
   Bot shows: Flight 1111 (white), 🔴 Flight 2222 [CANCELLED] (RED), Flight 3333 (white)
```

**Result:** Cancelled bookings PERSIST in the list and ALWAYS show in RED! ✅

## Technical Implementation:

### 1. **Backend - SHOW ALL Bookings (Including Cancelled)** ✅

**File:** `support/views.py`

**Removed `.exclude(current_status='Cancelled')` from ALL 7 locations:**

```python
# Before:
qs = Booking.objects.filter(pnr__iexact=pnr).exclude(current_status='Cancelled')

# After:
qs = Booking.objects.filter(pnr__iexact=pnr)  # Shows ALL bookings!
```

**Changed in:**
1. `api_list_bookings_by_pnr()` - Line 157
2. Short intents check - Line 280
3. "Show my bookings" query - Line 286
4. Cancel trip flow - Line 298
5. Flight status query - Line 318
6. Seat availability - Line 334
7. Pet travel query - Line 354

**Result:** Backend ALWAYS returns ALL bookings, including cancelled ones

---

### 2. **Frontend - Display Cancelled in Red** ✅

**File:** `templates/support/chat.html`

**The `showBookings()` function already has logic to:**
- Detect `booking.current_status === 'Cancelled'`
- Apply `booking-cancelled` CSS class (red border + red background)
- Show red "CANCELLED" badge
- Make cancelled bookings unclickable

**CSS Styling:**
```css
.booking-cancelled { 
  border: 2px solid #dc3545 !important;  /* Red border */
  background: #fff5f5 !important;         /* Light red background */
  cursor: not-allowed !important;
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

---

### 3. **After Cancellation - Refresh List** ✅

**When user cancels a booking:**
```javascript
fetch('/api/flight/cancel', {...})
  .then(result=>{
    addMessage('Your booking has been cancelled successfully', 'bot');
    
    // Refresh the booking list to show cancelled booking in red
    addMessage('Updated booking list:', 'bot');
    fetch('/api/bookings?pnr=' + pnr)
      .then(bookings=>{
        showBookings(bookings);  // Cancelled booking shows in RED
      });
  });
```

**Result:** Immediately after cancellation, the list refreshes and shows the cancelled booking in RED

---
